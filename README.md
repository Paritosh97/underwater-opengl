## Usage

  

1. Navigate to src/

  

2. Install the necessary libraries by running,

    pip install -r requirements.txt

  

3. run :

    python run.py

    



  

## What's implemented :

  

- Underwater Skybox

  

- Underwater Terrain

  

- 24 randomly placed and animated fish models

  

- Randomly placed seaweed at seabed

  

- Randomly placed coral

  
  

## Challenges :

  

- Animations for fishes and random movements

  

- Shader for phong, textures and skeletal animations

  

- Implementing the Skybox

  
  

## Possible improvements :

  

- Caustics - Worley noise, water effects in 2nd draw

  

- Depth Shadow Mapping

  

- Bubbles - Implementing a particle system

  

- Improved controls for controlling humanoid or fish - A 3rd/1st person camera control class

  

- Collision detection between objects - Implementing a Physics Engine

  

- Improvements in fish movements - Implementing flocking/boids simulation.
